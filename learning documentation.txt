when to to use what is most important:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Z7fbCLSTw&t=381s&ab_channel=Fireship

1. key:value -> stored in ram / cache -> very fast
no qureys or joins -> data modulationion limited 
not for main data/primary -> mostly used to reduce data latency

2. wide colomn -> no schema -> can handle untructured data -> query language / no joins
time series/historical records
high write low read
not primary

3. document oriented
store 
schmema less - relationalish qureys - no joins

4. relational db
need schema
consistent
